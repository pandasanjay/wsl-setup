        curl -L -O "https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh"
        bash Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh
        ```
5. **Install NVIDIA Driver**
     https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/wsl-user-guide/index.html#cuda-support-for-wsl-2
     - Currently below version works in my sytem
        Driver Version: 538.95       
        CUDA Version: 12.2   

6. **Setup Python environment**

    - Verify the installation by running: `nvcc --version`.

7. **Create a Mamba environment with CUDA GPU support**
    - Ensure you have the NVIDIA drivers installed on your system.
    - Create a new Conda environment with CUDA support: `mamba create -n cuda12-2 python=3.9`.
    - Activate the environment: `mamba activate cuda12-2`.

## System Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### Running monitor_performance.ps1

If your system feels sluggish or hangs often for no obvious reason, you can use the `monitor_performance.ps1` script to help diagnose performance issues.

**When to Run:**
- When your system is slow, unresponsive, or hangs frequently without any clear reason.

**How to Run:**
1. Open **PowerShell** in **Administrator mode**.
2. Navigate to the directory containing `monitor_performance.ps1`.
3. Execute the script with:
   ```powershell
   .\monitor_performance.ps1
   ```
4. Follow any on-screen instructions provided by the script.

This script will collect and display system performance information to help you identify potential issues.

## WSL Disk Cleanup & Reclaiming Space

### 1. Run `wsl_disk_cleanup.sh`

- **Purpose:** Frees up disk space by cleaning up unnecessary files and package caches inside your WSL instance.
- **How to Use:**
  1. Place `wsl_disk_cleanup.sh` in your Linux home directory (or any preferred location).
  2. Make it executable:
     ```sh
     chmod +x wsl_disk_cleanup.sh
     ```
  3. Run the script:
     ```sh
     ./wsl_disk_cleanup.sh
     ```
- **What to Expect:**  
  The script will:
  - Clean up package cache with `sudo apt-get clean`
  - Remove unused packages with `sudo apt-get autoremove`
  - Clean temporary files and logs
  - You will see output messages summarizing freed space and actions taken.

### 2. Reclaim Space Using Optimize-VHD

- **Purpose:** Shrinks the virtual disk file used by WSL2 to reclaim freed space back on your Windows host.
- **How to Use:**
  1. Open **PowerShell as Administrator**.
  2. Run:
     ```powershell
     Optimize-VHD -Path "C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Packages\CanonicalGroupLimited.Ubuntu22.04LTS_79rhkp1fndgsc\LocalState\ext4.vhdx" -Mode Full
     ```
- **What to Expect:**  
  This operation may take several minutes. When finished, the ext4.vhdx file will be smaller if there was unused space to reclaim.

### 3. Finding Your VHDX Path

- Each WSL distribution has its own vhdx file.
- The path generally looks like:
  ```
  C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\Packages\<DistroPackageName>\LocalState\ext4.vhdx
  ```
- **How to Find It:**
  1. List installed WSL distributions:
     ```powershell
     wsl --list --verbose
     ```
  2. Find the folder in:
     ```
     %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Packages
     ```
     Matching your distribution (e.g., contains `Ubuntu22.04LTS`).
  3. The vhdx file is inside that folderâ€™s `LocalState` directory.
